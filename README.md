## ⚠️ Important Notice: SpikeAgent Has Moved to a New Home

We are continuously improving **SpikeAgent**, and an updated, significantly more powerful version is now actively maintained at:

👉 **https://github.com/SpikeAgent/SpikeAgent**

This new repository reflects months of refinement and community feedback, and includes major new capabilities such as:

- **Automated merging of units** for cleaner, more accurate spike catalogs  
- **Drift correction support**, including compatibility with tools like *dredge*  
- Numerous enhancements in robustness, performance, and agentic behavior  

We have also (and keep improving) **packaged the ecosystem more cleanly**, including providing official containers for easier deployment and reproducibility.  
You can find the new container builds here:

👉 **https://github.com/arnaumarin/SpikeAgent/pkgs/container/spikeagent-cpu**

By creating a dedicated, standalone repository for ongoing development, we aim to maintain SpikeAgent more effectively, streamline updates, and support a growing user community.

We encourage all users to transition to the new repository and take advantage of these improvements.  
As always, we warmly welcome community contributions — please open issues or pull requests in the **new repo** if you encounter bugs, have ideas, or want to get involved.

Thank you for helping us make SpikeAgent better for everyone!
